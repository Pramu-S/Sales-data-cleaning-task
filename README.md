   - `TERRITORY`: Replaced with `'Unknown'`

3. **Standardized Column Headers**
   - Renamed columns to lowercase and replaced spaces with underscores (e.g., `Order Date` â†’ `order_date`).

4. **Formatted Date Fields**
   - Standardized the `order_date` column format to `DD-MM-YYYY` using Excel's date formatting tools.

5. **Checked and Verified Data Types**
